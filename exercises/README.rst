How to run the examples
-----

After setting up the odesolvers package (see `here <../README.rst>`_), run

.. code-block:: bash

	$ cd <project-home>/exercises
	$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

You are now able to run the scripts in the folder exercises. For example, to run hw2ex4.py, do

.. code-block:: bash

	$ cd <project-home>/exercises
	$ python3 hw2ex4.py
